     <h4>Cookies and Cream</h4>
     <p>Calling all Oreo cookie lovers! This treat has Oreo 
      cookie crumbles mixed into the vanilla cake batter and
      the french vanilla buttercream as well. A classic Oreo
      cookie tops this cake -- we'll let you decide which

      Vanilla cake is mixed with colorful sprinkles and topped with 
      french vanilla buttercream. We top it off with more sprinkles,

     <p>Exclusively available during the fall, this pumpkin cupcake 
       is sure to be a favorite! We use Eddie's family recipe for pumpkin
      sweet bread and top it with cinnamon buttercream. Simple, but oh so 
      delicious.</p>

       walnuts, cinnamon, and bananas. The cream cheese is literally the frosting
       on this wonderfully tasty cake.
